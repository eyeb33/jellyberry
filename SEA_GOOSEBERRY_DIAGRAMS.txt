Legend:
  █ = Brightest (wave center, magenta/green hues)
  ▓ = Bright (cyan/blue hues)
  ▒ = Medium (blue hues)
  ░ = Dim (deep blue)
  (blank) = Black/off

Notice:
1. Wave peaks are phase-shifted left-to-right (rotation effect)
2. Primary strips (P) are brighter than dimmer strips (D)
3. Colors shift through rainbow spectrum along each wave
4. Multiple waves overlap for depth


PHASE OFFSET DIAGRAM (shows rotation):

Time=0ms:    Strip 0 has wave at row 4
Time=100ms:  Strip 1 has wave at row 4  } Rotation effect
Time=200ms:  Strip 2 has wave at row 4  } (wave seems to move around sphere)
Time=300ms:  Strip 3 has wave at row 4  }
...

Each strip's wave is phase-offset by ~0.083 (1/12 of full cycle)
Plus ±5% random jitter for organic feel
